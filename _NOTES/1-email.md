Hi Nazario,

We're excited to move you forward to the Take-Home Challenge. This exercise is based on a real problem from our product and is intentionally open-ended.
What we look for in strong submissions

MVP focus: make the core workflow work end-to-end before adding extras
Product sense: reasonable assumptions around meal timing, composition, and variety
Code quality: clear structure, modular functions, strong typing
Reliability: correct logic, edge-case handling, and tests for core behavior
Reasoning: Clear rationale for key decisions and tradeoffs
A complete, well-reasoned MVP with clean structure will score higher than a broad but shallow solution.

You may use AI tools, but submissions with obvious AI-driven inaccuracies (incorrect architecture, broken assumptions, missed core requirements) will be declined.
Instructions

Download the challenge.zip.
Follow the instructions in the README file in the root directory contains the instructions for the exercise.
Please provide a short README explaining your design decisions and tradeoffs.
Upload your completed solution (as a .zip) via this form and respond back to this email to confirm within 7 days.
We will review your take-home internally within 24 hours on weekdays. If your submission passes, we will invite you to schedule a 45 min Takehome Review to walk through your solution and decisions.
If you need an extension, please let us know before the deadline.
If you have any questions while completing the challenge, feel free to reach out.

We're looking forward to reviewing your work!
