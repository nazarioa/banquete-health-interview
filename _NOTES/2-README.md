Nazario (niz, naz) thought process
==================================

Kind of stream of conscious.

**product**

Just read the requirements. Sounds similar to another company that was used a lot before the pandemic when people worked in office. The company made or gathered meals for office employees.

A user could set up their meal preferences ahead of time in case they forgot to place an order on time. preferences included allergens, types of protein, cuisine, etc.

**technical**

Looking through the code base it does look like redwoodJS structure.
I have not looked at every file yet but I will initiate a git repo and then run npm install just to get it running and see what I have to work wth.

I see that there is also a docker file that I will explore shortly.

back of my mind is the product stuff I mentioned above.
